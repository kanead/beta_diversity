# Code, data and results for paper “Dispersal ability is associated with contrasting patterns of beta diversity of African small mammal communities”

## The data folder 
Has information on:
1. the sites were the three small mammal groups (bats, shrews and rodents) were found 
2. presence-absence matrices for the species within the three groups across sites
3. trait data for the three groups
4. a shape file of the biogeographic regions used in the paper
5. bioclimatic data from the sites, this is broken down into the three mammal groups and also presented as one file 

## The code folder 
The scripts are used to reveal mutiscale patterns of the species distributions across the biogeographic regions as well as beta diversity between groups using beta.pair() i.e. site by site comparisons

## The results folder 
Gives output as .R files for the three groups. These data are split into taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional beta diversity
